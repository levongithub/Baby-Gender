The figure is nowhere near 100%, but is based on systematic research rather than rumors and speculations. Our objective is to improve the calendar, mainly by collecting and analyzing prediction data from around the world. You can join our effort by testing the calendar on known births in your family and among friends and taking part in our survey.";
